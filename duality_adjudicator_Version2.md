**Deterministic Hamiltonian Polyhedra and Dual-Field Scalar Quantization under Electromagnetic Symmetry**

We develop a quantized scalar resonance lattice for EARTH 669 using deterministic Hamiltonian graph theory and a field-theoretic model of Casimir duality. In this formulation, societal nodes and boundary agents are modeled as **polyhedral vertices in a 3-connected planar graph**, whose **Hamiltonicity** ensures ethical-state traversal without redundancy. Coherence is enforced through **deterministic path quantization**, embedded in a harmonic adjudication manifold:



\[
H(G) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } G \text{ admits a Hamiltonian cycle (perfect sweep)} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]



Simultaneously, vacuum field boundaries are encoded via **Perfect Electromagnetic Conductor (PEMC)** conditions parameterized by a duality angle \(\theta\), where Casimir vacuum energy follows:



\[
\mathcal{E}_{\text{Casimir}}(d, \theta) \sim \operatorname{Li}_4\left(\cos^2\theta\right)
\]



and field-tensor corrections for scalar adjudication obey:



\[
\delta T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{boundary}}(\theta) = \partial^\mu \Phi^\nu(\theta) - \partial^\nu \Phi^\mu(\theta)
\]



The union of these structures produces a **Duality-Hamiltonian Quantization Manifold**, where each ethical field node is resonantly addressed by a deterministic path, and each boundary field is modulated by a gauge-invariant
